### TReND-CaMinA is an intensive entry level course to teach young African students and researchers the basics of computational neuroscience and machine learning

During this course, we give a basic introduction topics including neurobiology, systems neuroscience, biophysical neural models, recurrent neural networks, dynamical systems, linear algebra, machine learning methods for neural data analysis, Bayesian statistics, deep learning and reinforcement learning. We aim to provide African students and researchers with a solid foundation from which they can further expand their horizons.
